<!--Question 1 : What are semantic HTML elements? Why is using them important for web
development?-->

#ANSWER:-

- Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that provide meaning to the content they contain.
  They describe the purpose of the content rather than just how it should look.
  This is a shift from older HTML, which used tags like <div> and <span> for almost everything, 
  forcing developers to use class names to give them meaning.

  # Why Semantic HTML is Important:-
  Using semantic HTML is important for several reasons, 
  including improved accessibility, better SEO, and enhanced maintainability.


  #Examples of Semantic Elements:-
  Here are some common examples of semantic HTML elements and their uses:

  <header>
  <nav>
  <main> 
  <article>
  <section>
  <aside>
  <footer>

<!--Question 2: You're designing a blog page. Which semantic elements would you use to 
structure the page, and why?-->

#ANSWER:- 

      A well-structured blog page utilizes several HTML5 semantic elements 
      clearly define the purpose of different sections, which benefits
      accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

     # Here are the key semantic elements I would use and the reasoning:-

     Semantic Element	Usage on a Blog Page	Why Use It?
     <html>	The root element of the entire page.	
            Fundamental: Defines the start and end of the HTML document.

     <head>	Contains meta-information about the HTML document 
            (e.g., title, character set, links to CSS/JS).
            Metadata: Essential for the browser, search engines, and social media sharing.

     <body>	Contains all the visible content of the page.	
            Content Container: Holds everything the user sees.

    <header> Typically placed at the top of the entire page or within an article.
             It contains introductory content, often a logo, site title,
             and main navigation.	
             Branding/Identity: Clearly identifies the top section of the page 
             or the introductory part of an individual article.

    <nav>  	 Contains the primary navigation links for the site
             (e.g., Home, About, Categories).
   	         Navigation: Explicitly marks the main link structure, making it
             easy for screen readers and search engines to find site navigation.


     <main> 	Encloses the dominant content unique to this blog page
              (e.g., the main list of blog posts or the full content of a single blog post).
            	Primary Content: Designates the main topic of the document. 
              Crucial for accessibility (screen readers can jump straight to it) and
              SEO (highlights the most important content).
              There should be only one per document.


     <article>	Used for a self-contained piece of content that could be
                distributed and reused independently
                (e.g., an individual blog post or a comment).
    	          Self-Contained Content: Clearly separates a single post from the 
                rest of the page content.


     <section>	Groups together content that is thematically related but isn't
                a stand-alone article (e.g., a "Featured Posts" area, or the "About the Author" box).
                Thematic Grouping: Provides a way to break up the main content into logical sub-groups.

     <aside>	Content that is indirectly related to the main content,
              often presented as a sidebar (e.g., "Related Posts," "Archives," "Social Media Links," or ads).
   	          Supplemental Content: Clearly indicates content that is separate from the primary 
              flow, often used for sidebars.


     <footer>	Placed at the bottom of the entire page or within an <article>. 
              It contains authorship information, copyright data, contact info, or secondary links.	
              Conclusion/Meta-Info: Clearly marks the end section of the page or article,
              often containing legal and supplementary information.

              ]
     <h1> - <h6>	Used for headings to create an outline of the content.
                 <h1> for the main page title 
                  (e.g., the blog's name or the title of the individual post).
    	           Hierarchy/Outline: Establishes the structural importance of the content,
                 which is vital for SEO and accessibility.


     <figure> and <figcaption> 
                    Used to wrap an image, code block, or illustration,
                    and provide a caption for it.
   	                Media/Context: Associates a caption directly with its media, 
                    making the content more accessible and understandable.

<!--Question 3: How can you make an HTML form more accessible to users with 
disabilities?-->

#ANSWER:-
        
        Making an HTML form accessible is crucial for users with disabilities,
         especially those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

         #Here are the key methods to ensure form accessibility:

        1. Programmatically Associate Labels and Inputs.
        2. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility and Focus.
        3. Group Related Controls.
        4. Handle Errors and Instructions Clearly.
        5. Utilize ARIA and HTML5 Attributes.

<!--Question 4: Identify and correct the errors in the following CSS code: 
p { 
font-size: 16; 
color: #333 
margin-top 10px; 
}-->

#ANSWER:- the provided CSS code has three syntax errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------
          Here is the original code with errors:

         p { 
         font-size: 16; /* Error 1: Missing unit */
        color: #333 /* Error 2: Missing semicolon */
         margin-top 10px; /* Error 3: Missing colon */
        }
--------------------------------------------------------------

        correct code:- 

                p { 
          font-size: 16px; 
          color: #333; 
          margin-top: 10px; 
         }

 <!--Question 5: Write CSS rules to style all <h2> elements inside a <section> with a blue 
color and center alignment.-->

#ANSWER:- 
         The key to this request is the descendant selector section h2.
         This rule applies the styling only to <h2> elements nested anywhere inside a <section>.

        #Here is the updated HTML file demonstrating the specific CSS rule you asked for:-

         This single file contains the CSS you requested.
          Notice how the nested <h2> is also styled, because the descendant selector targets any <h2> inside the parent <section>.

        If you only wanted to target direct children (i.e., <h2> elements immediately inside a <section>, not deeply nested ones),
         you would use the child selector: section > h2.

 <!--Question 6: Explain the CSS box model and its components.-->

#ANSWER:-
         The CSS Box Model describes how elements are rendered on a web page as rectangular boxes.
        Every element is made up of four layers that control its size, spacing, and appearance:

        Content:
         The innermost area, holding the actual content (text, images, etc.). 
         Its size is defined by the element's width and height.

        Padding:
         The transparent space between the Content and the Border. 
         It adds inner spacing and takes on the element's background color.

        Border:
         A line surrounding the Padding. This is the visible boundary of the box.

        Margin: 
        The transparent space surrounding the Border.
         It controls the separation between the element and other adjacent elements.

         In short, the box model determines the total space an element occupies:

<!--Question 7: How do the relative, absolute, and fixed positioning properties differ in 
CSS? -->

#ANSWER:- 
        The difference primarily lies in what the element is positioned relative to
         (its offset parent) and whether it stays in the document flow:

        1.position: relative;
         Flow: Stays in the normal document flow.
         Reference: Positioned relative to its original position. 
         Shifting it (top, left, etc.) leaves a gap behind.

        2.position: absolute;
         Flow: Removed from the document flow.
         Reference: Positioned relative to its closest ancestor that
          has a position value other than static.

        3.position: fixed;
         Flow: Removed from the document flow.
         Reference: Positioned relative to the viewport (browser window). 
         It stays locked in place even when the user scrolls.


         Basically, relative moves the element but saves its space; absolute moves the 
         element relative to a parent and loses its space; and fixed moves the element relative
          to the screen and never moves when scrolling.

<!--Question 8: Write a CSS rule to set a background image for a <div> with the class 
.banner, ensuring the image covers the entire area without repeating. -->

#ANSWER:- 
         The necessary CSS rule involves combining three properties:

         CSS code :-

         .banner {
          background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
          background-repeat: no-repeat;
          background-size: cover;
          }


         Brief Explanation:

         background-image sets the source URL of the image.

         background-repeat: no-repeat; prevents the image from tiling across the element.

         background-size: cover; ensures the image is scaled to be as large as possible to cover the entire container area,
          clipping any excess if necessary.
